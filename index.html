        <p>The dog is a loving companion to a man. He is happy to go everywhere with his master. He shows his affection
            for
            his master by wagging his tail and licking his hand or face.
            If his master is blind, the dog helps him to cross the street and acts as his loving guide. No man can feel
            lonely when he has a dog for company.

            A dog keeps watch over his master’s house. He will not allow anyone to touch anything belonging to his
            master.
            He will bark when a stranger approaches the house.

            The dog is a loving companion to a man. He is happy to go everywhere with his master. He shows his affection

            his master by wagging his tail and licking his hand or face.


            If his master is blind, the dog helps him to cross the street and acts as his loving guide. No man can feel
            lonely when he has a dog for company.

            A dog keeps watch over his master’s house. He will not allow anyone to touch anything belonging to his
            master.
            He will bark when a stranger approaches the house.

            A dog is loyal and faithful to his master. Nothing will induce him to leave his master. His master might be
            a
            poor man or even a beggar but, still his dog will not leave him to go with anyone else. A dog worships his
            master as if he were a God.

            A dog has a sharp sense of hearing and smell. He can hear footsteps from a great distance. At night he will
            be
            up and about at the least sound. He can smell his master from far off. He will rush out of the house to jump
            on
            his master and welcome him home.

            A friend is one who is ready to help a man in his moment of need. So a dog is really man’s best friend. He
            is
            prepared to die rather than allow any harm to come to his master.

            Dogs have been known to die to save their masters. A dog might even die of grief after his master is dead.
            He is
            certainly a true and faithful friend. It is right to call him man’s best friend.
